# CM2030_angryBirdClone
An implementation of a physics engine to create a similar effect as the angry birdâ€™s game.

The matter physics library was implemented in this project to create an interactive world. Objects were giving interesting properties by using constraints and setting up composite elements.

This was one of four mini projects that amounted to my Midterm submission for CM2030 Graphics Programming

The other projects were:
  
  CM2030_asteroidClone
  CM2030_noisyGrid
  CM2030_solarSystem

This project utilizes JavaScript, the p5.js library, and matter physics library to create an interactable 2D world.
